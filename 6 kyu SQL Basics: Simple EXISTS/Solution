PROBLEM STATEMENT:
For this challenge you need to create a SELECT statement that will contain data about departments that had a sale with a price over 98.00 dollars. This SELECT statement will have to use an EXISTS to achieve the task.

departments table schema
id
name

sales table schema
id
department_id (department foreign key)
name
price
card_name
card_number
transaction_date

resultant table schema
id
name


SOLUTION:
SELECT *
FROM departments d
WHERE EXISTS 
  (SELECT 
    price 
   FROM sales s
   WHERE d.id = s.department_id AND s.price > 98
  )
  

NOTES:
Reference Stack Overflow for when to use a JOIN vs EXSISTS: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7082449/exists-vs-join-and-use-of-exists-clause

1. Select the fields you want returned in your table output
- in this case we want to return only the department id and name. These are the only two columns in the department table so we can select *
2. Execute the WHERE EXISTS operator
- since the sales data is in the sales table, we need to tap into it to ensure we're only pulling departments that have had a sale over $98. 
- we don't need to return this data in our output, but we do need to access the data in a where clause
- this is why we don't want to JOIN tables, rather we just want to check if the boolean output in the exists clause is True
