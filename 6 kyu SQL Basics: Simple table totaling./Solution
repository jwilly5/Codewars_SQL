For this challenge you need to create a simple query to display each unique clan with their total points and ranked by their total points.

people table schema
name
points
clan
You should then return a table that resembles below

select on
rank
clan
total_points
total_people
The query must rank each clan by their total_points, you must return each unqiue clan and if there is no clan name (i.e. it's an empty string) you must replace it with [no clan specified], you must sum the total_points for each clan and the total_people within that clan.

##Note The data is loaded from the live leaderboard, this means values will change but also could cause the kata to time out retreiving the information.


SOLUTION:
SELECT 
  COALESCE(NULLIF(p.clan, ''), '[no clan specified]') AS "clan",
  SUM(p.points) AS "total_points",
  COUNT(p.name) AS "total_people",
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(p.points) DESC) AS "rank"
FROM people p
GROUP BY p.clan
