Create a simple SELECT query to display student information of all ACTIVE students.

TABLE STRUCTURE:

students
Id	FirstName	LastName	IsActive

Note: IsActive (true or false)


SOLUTION:
SELECT *
FROM students s
WHERE s.IsActive = 1


NOTES:
When using the WHERE clause on a boolean attribute, you need to use 1 as true, or 0 as false. You do not write out true/false.
