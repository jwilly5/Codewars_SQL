There is an events table used to track different key activities taken on a website. For this task you need to:

find the entries whose name equals "trained"
group them by the day the activity happened (the date part of the created_at timestamp) and their description's
the 2 aforementioned fields should be returned together with the number of grouped entries in a column called count
the result should also be sorted by day

"events" table schema
id (bigint)
name (text)
created_at (timestamp)
description (text)

expected result schema
day (date)
description (text)
count (numeric)


SOLUTION:
SELECT 
  DATE(e.created_at) AS "day",
  e.description,
  COUNT(*) AS "count"
FROM events e
WHERE e.name = 'trained'
GROUP BY "day", e.description


NOTES:
- make sure you group by "day", not by created_at
