PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Given the following table 'decimals':

decimals table schema
id
number1
number2
Return a table with a single column result which is the output of number1 raised to the power of number2.


SOLUTION:
SELECT 
  (d.number1)^(d.number2) AS "result"
FROM decimals d


NOTES:
Solving this problem really only takes the understanding that using the "^" key is used to raise a number to the power of x. 
So with this, you are selecting the number from column number1 and raising it to the power of the number in column number2

Alternatively, you can use the "pow" function. In this case you can raise a number to the power of by stating 'pow(number1, number2).
